/**
 * @defgroup LArSoftProxyTracks proxy::Tracks (recob::Track proxy)
 * @brief Proxy for a `recob::Track` collection.
 * @ingroup LArSoftProxyReco
 *
 *
 * Track proxies is a way to facilitate the navigation of `recob::Track` data
 * objects.
 * The ensemble of fundamental data of a track collection includes:
 * * the tracks themselves, in a `std::vector<recob::Track>` collection
 * * the associated hits, in a `art::Assns<recob::Track, recob::Hit>` data
 *   product
 *
 * Special customisations are provided for:
 * * the associated hits (automatically pulled in): the
 *   information is provided with `recob::Hit` tag, with the
 *   dedicated accessor `hits()`, `nHits()` and `hitAtPoint()` of the track
 *    proxy and with `hitPtr()` and `hit()` when accessing a single point
 * * the track fit information: include it with `withFitHitInfo()`; the
 *   information is provided with `recob::TrackFitHitInfo` tag, with the
 *   dedicated accessor `fitInfoAtPoint()` of the track proxy and with
 *   `fitInfoPtr()` when accessing a single point
 *
 * LArSoft prescribes conventions to be followed, which include:
 * * a track has at least two trajectory points
 * * for each track, there is one hit per trajectory point
 * * the association between tracks and hits is created with tracks as first
 *   ("left") element, and hits as second one ("right")
 * * hits in the association are in a well-defined order: first are the hits of
 *   the first track, sorted in the same way as their trajectory points; then
 *   the second track hits come, likewise; and all tracks follow in order;
 *   this is called the "one-to-many sequential association" requirement
 *   documented in `ProxyBase.h`.
 *
 * For track data products respecting this convention, a track proxy provides
 * an interface to navigate the track information.
 *
 * @note The interface is experimental, and it is likely not to include all the
 *       features you may need. If you find a missing feature, or find a use
 *       case violating an assumption, or you find the interface cumbersome to
 *       use, please contact the author for a discussion on how to improve this
 *       utility.
 *
 *
 * Obtaining a track proxy
 * ========================
 *
 * Track proxies are created by specifying the tag of the tracks, and the event
 * to read them from.
 *
 * To create a track proxy:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
 * auto tracks = proxy::getCollection<proxy::Tracks>(event, tracksTag);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Here we ask `getCollection()` to create a proxy of category `proxy::Tracks`.
 * Each proxy is a different beast which needs to be explicitly supported:
 * here support for the proxy to `recob::Track` is described.
 *
 * The additional customizations for track proxy are described above.
 * For example, if the module with label `fitTag` stored the fit information for
 * the track, that information can be merged as:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
 * auto tracks = proxy::getCollection<proxy::Tracks>
 *   (event, tracksTag, withFitHitInfo(fitTag));
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * while in the more likely case where that information was produced together
 * with the tracks,
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
 * auto tracks = proxy::getCollection<proxy::Tracks>
 *   (event, tracksTag, withFitHitInfo());
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * will suffice. After this, the interface specific to `recob::TrackFitHitInfo`
 * will be available. Otherwise, any attempt to use it will cause (complicate)
 * compilation errors.
 *
 * In addition, any type of data can be associated using the generic collection
 * proxy interface (`withAssociated()`, `withParallelData()`, etc.).
 *
 *
 * The C++ type of `tracks` object should not matter to the user, and it depends
 * on which additional data are merged in.
 *
 *
 * Types of proxies, and what to do with them
 * ===========================================
 *
 * Currently there are three different type of proxy-like objects for tracks.
 * Each one supports a specific concept:
 *
 * * `proxy::Tracks` represents the whole collection of tracks; it covers
 *   the tracks themselves, and their associated hits. It is obtained by calling
 *   `getCollection()` as described above.
 * * `proxy::Track` represents a single track; the list of hits and points,
 *   and of course the `recob::Track` object itself, can be accessed through it.
 *   Track proxies are obtained from a track collection proxy (`proxy::Tracks`).
 * * `proxy::TrackPoint` represents a single trajectory point in a track.
 *   It provide access to position and momentum of the track at that point,
 *   associated hit and point flags. Track point proxies are obtained from a
 *   track proxy (`proxy::Track`).
 *
 * For the details of the interface and the information that is exposed by each
 * of these proxy classes, please refer to each class documentation. In
 * particular, see `proxy::Tracks` documentation for more usage examples.
 *
 * @note The interface allows by deliberate design only read-only access to the
 *       underlying data.
 *
 *
 * @section LArSoftProxyTracksTech Technical details
 *
 * @subsection LArSoftProxyTracksTechDetails Track collection proxy
 *
 * The track collection proxy object is derived from
 * `proxy::CollectionProxyBase`, which points to the original (track) data
 * product.
 * In addition, it contains a `proxy::details::AssociatedData` object for
 * the `recob::Track`--`recob::Hit` association list.
 *
 * The `proxy::Tracks` interface is currently quite limited: it only allows to
 * access a track by index, or to iterate through all of them, in addition to
 * know how many tracks are available (`size()`).
 *
 * The object returned when accessing the single track information,
 * `proxy::Track`, actually contains enough information so that it is
 * independent of the track collection proxy. This is derived from the generic
 * collection element proxy object (`proxy::CollectionProxyElement`).
 *
 * The object describing the information of a single point has the interface of
 * `TrackPointWrapper`. The underlying storage includes pointers to the track,
 * the associated hit, and the index of the point in the track. This is
 * track-specific and it is not part of the generic proxy infrastructure.
 *
 *
 * @subsection LArSoftProxyTracksCustom Track proxy as an example of proxy customization
 *
 * The proxy utilities provide the basic functionality of the track proxy,
 * including the track collection proxy, representing all the tracks in the
 * event, and the track proxy, representing a single track. Access to a third
 * tier, the single trajectory point, as proxy is not covered by the basic
 * framework, and it has been implemented here from scratch.
 *
 * The most relevant customization pertains proxy to the single track. The proxy
 * is derived from `proxy::details::CollectionProxyElement` for basic
 * functionality, which is enriched by a custom interface that does not in fact
 * add functionality, except for the trajectory point proxy described below.
 * The customizations are fairly trivial, overlaying user-friendly names on the
 * existing functionality. A step beyond that is the access to data that might
 * not be present, that is the fit information. The proxy takes the necessary
 * steps to determine (statically) whether that information is present, and to
 * provide a null pointer to the information if that is not the case. This is
 * a functionality that can't be completely implemented by the basic proxy code,
 * since that generic code has no clue about what type of null pointer to return
 * when the tag `Tracks::TrackFitHitInfoTag` is unknown. This information is
 * provided by the track proxy via the `getIf()` call.
 * For convenience, `proxy::Track` is defined as alias of this single track
 * proxy.
 *
 * The collection proxy customization is way more straightforward.
 * A proxy "tag" is defined, `proxy::Tracks`, with the only purpose of
 * identifying the collection proxy for tracks. For convenience, it hosts a
 * definition used internally to identify one of the optional auxiliary data,
 * and the type of the main data product, but both definitions are contingent
 * and their presence in there is only to centralize some customization in a
 * single place.
 * Traits (`CollectionProxyMakerTraits<Tracks>`) are specialized to inform that
 * this `proxy::Tracks` proxy relies on `std::vector<recob::Track>` as main
 * data product collection type (`std::vector<recob::Track>` is learned from
 * `proxy::Tracks`, but again, this is a contingent detail). The only other
 * customization we need is to have for our proxy our element class above: since
 * we can use the standard collection base, just with the custom element, we
 * define `collection_proxy_impl_t` in that way.
 * Finally, the creation of the collection proxy is customised by specializing
 * `CollectionProxyMaker` (`CollectionProxyMaker<Tracks>`). That class normally
 * takes care of creating the whole proxy, and our purpose is to have it always
 * add the associated hits as auxiliary data, so that the caller does not have
 * to explicitly use `withAssociated<recob::Hit>()` in `getCollection()`.
 * The simple customization does exactly that, under the hood.
 * As candy, some customized functions may be provided for convenience, like
 * `withFitHitInfo()` as alias of `withAssociated<recob::TrackFitHitInfo>()`.
 *
 *
 * The trajectory point proxy has been implemented from scratch here, and it is
 * much less refined than the generic proxy code. It is based on a data
 * structure with a selected list of pointers to the actual data. This structure
 * is implemented as a `std::tuple`. On top of it, a wrapper provides the
 * interface (by interface substitution). This choice is non-essential and has
 * been taken to stress the separation between data storage and interface.
 * Point data structures are created by the proxy on demand, and they are
 * designed so that they don't become invalid when the original proxies fall out
 * of scope, at the price of added memory usage (the minimal information would
 * be a pointer to the track proxy and a point index).
 *
 * Summary of the customization procedure:
 * -# define the tag to identify the proxy (`proxy::Tracks`)
 * -# choose what type of object that will be (`proxy::CollectionProxyBase`
 *      should do for most)
 * -# (_optional_) customize the element type; deriving it from
 *      `proxy::CollectionProxyElement` is recommended
 * -# define the main data product type (`std::vector<recob::Track>`) and set
 *     the traits of the collection proxy, often deriving them from
 *     `proxy::CollectionProxyMakerTraits` with the main data product type as
 *     template argument is enough; in this example, we specified a collection
 *     proxy object with customized element though
 * -# customize the creation of the proxy collection, if special logic or
 *     default components are specified for the proxy (here,
 *     `withAssociated<recob::Hit>()`);
 *     in this case, `proxy::CollectionProxyMaker` must be specialized (for
 *     `proxy::Tracks`), and a starting point may be to derive the
 *     specialization from `proxy::CollectionProxyMakerBase` and redefine its
 *     `make()` member
 *

   * This type can be used to get a proxy for `recob::Track` collection:

   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   *
   * An example of usage for a simple track processing loop:
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
   * void MyAnalyzer::analyze(art::Event const& event) {
   *
   *   auto tracks = proxy::getCollection<proxy::Tracks>
   *     (event, tracksTag, proxy::withFitHitInfo());
   *
   *   if (tracks.empty()) {
   *     mf::LogVerbatim("TrackProxyTest")
   *       << "No tracks in '" << tracksTag.encode() << "'";
   *     return;
   *   }
   *
   *   mf::LogVerbatim("TrackProxyTest") << "Collection '" << tracksTag.encode()
   *     << "' contains " << tracks.size() << " tracks.";
   *
   *   for (auto track: tracks) {
   *
   *     recob::Track const& trackRef = track.track();
   *
   *     mf::LogVerbatim log("TrackProxyTest");
   *     log << "[#" << track.index() << "] track " << trackRef
   *       << "\n  with " << trackRef.NPoints() << " points and "
   *       << track.nHits() << " hits:";
   *
   *     for (auto const& point: track.points()) {
   *       log <<
   *         "\n  [#" << point.index() << "] at " << point.position()
   *           << " (momentum: " << point.momentum() << "), flags: "
   *           << point.flags();
   *
   *       recob::Hit const* hit = point.hit();
   *       if (hit) {
   *         log << " with a Q=" << hit->Integral() << " hit on channel "
   *           << hit->Channel() << " at tick " << hit->PeakTime()
   *           << ", measured: " << point.fitInfoPtr()->hitMeas();
   *       }
   *       else
   *         log << " (no associated hit)";
   *
   *     } // for points in track
   *
   *   } // for track
   *
   * } // MyAnalyzer::analyze()
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * In this example, the track proxy accesses the track itself, its associated
   * hits (always implicitly present) and the track fit hit information
   * (explicitly requested). Since both those data products are produced by the
   * same module as the track, there is no need to specify their producer module
   * label.
   *
   * Unfortunately, the proxy object (`tracks` in the example) can be of a
   * different class depending on which data is merged into it: a proxy created
   * by `getCollection<proxy::Tracks>(event, tag, proxy::withFitHitInfo())` has
   * different type than e.g. `getCollection<proxy::Tracks>(event, tag)`.
   * This implies than when passing proxies as arguments to functions, template
   * types must be used. For example, the following code is equivalent to the
   * one above, but with methods processing a single track (a track proxy) and
   * a single trajectory point (a track point proxy):
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
   * template <typename TrackPoint>

   *       << " (momentum: " << point.momentum() << "), flags: "
   *       << point.flags();
   *
   *   recob::Hit const* hit = point.hit();
   *   if (hit) {
   *     log << " with a Q=" << hit->Integral() << " hit on channel "
   *       << hit->Channel() << " at tick " << hit->PeakTime()
   *       << ", measured: " << point.fitInfoPtr()->hitMeas();

   *
   *   } // for track
   *
   * } // MyAnalyzer::proxyUsageExample()
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   *
   * As any other proxy object, other data can be merged to the proxy, but no
   * custom interface will be available. For example:
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
   * auto tracks = proxy::getCollection<proxy::Tracks>(
   *   event, tracksTag,
   *   proxy::withParallelData<recob::TrackMomentumFit>(momTag)
   *   );
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * will add a data product `std::vector<recob::TrackMomentumFit>` expected to
   * have one element (of type `recob::TrackMomentumFit`) per track, which will
   * be accessed with the generic proxy interface:
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
   * for (auto track: tracks) {
   *   recob::TrackMomentumFit const& momFit
   *     = track.get<recob::TrackMomentumFit>();
   *   // ...
   * }
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * The other common features of proxy collections are supported, like tagging
   * of different instances of the same data types:
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
   * struct MCS {};
   * struct Range {};
   * auto tracks = proxy::getCollection<proxy::Tracks>(
   *   event, tracksTag,
   *   proxy::withParallelDataAs<recob::TrackMomentumFit, Range>(rangeMomTag),
   *   proxy::withParallelDataAs<recob::TrackMomentumFit, MCS>(MCStag)
   *   );
   * for (auto track: tracks) {
   *   recob::TrackMomentumFit const& rangeMom = track.get<Range>();
   *   recob::TrackMomentumFit const& MCSmom = track.get<MCS>();
   *   // ...
   * }
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   *
   * A new, filtered collection of proxies can be created with obvious means and
   * with a less-than-friendly declaration:
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
   * std::vector<decltype(tracks)::element_proxy_t> longTracks;
   * for (auto track: tracks) {
   *   if (track->Length() >= 30.0) longTracks.push_back(track);
   * }
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * The collection thus created (`longTracks`) is valid also after the
   * collection proxy (`tracks`) has fallen out of scope.
   *
   *
   * @note `proxy::Tracks` is *not* the type of the collection proxy returned
   *       by `getCollection()`.
