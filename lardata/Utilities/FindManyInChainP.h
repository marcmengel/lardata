   * @brief  Query object collecting a list of associated objects.
   * @tparam Target type of objects to be fetched
   * @tparam Intermediate types of objects connecting to Target by association
   *
   * This query object collects information about all objects of type `Target`
   * associated to each specified object of type `Source`.
   * The `Source` type is implicitly specified in the constructor.
   * For example, each `recob::Shower` object is expected to be associated to
   * a number of `recob::Cluster` objects, and each one of these clusters must
   * be associated to `recob::Hit` objects. To retrieve all the hit objects
   * associated to a shower collection (_not recommended_):
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
   * auto showers = event.getValidHandle<std::vector<recob::Shower>>(showerTag);
   * lar::FindManyInChainP<recob::Hit, recob::Cluster> showerToHits
   *   (showers, event, showerTag);
   *
   * for (std::size_t iShower = 0; iShower < showers.size(); ++iShower) {
   *
   *   recob::Shower const& shower = (*showers)[iShower];
   *
   *   decltype(auto) showerHits = showerToHits.at(iShower);
   *
   *   // ...
   *
   * } // for each shower
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * In this example, it is explicitly stated that the producer of the shower
   * associations to clusters is the same as the producer of the showers, as the
   * same input tag `showerTag` is used. It is also implicitly assumed that the
   * same producer which created the associated clusters is also responsible
   * for the creation of the associations between clusters and hits.
   *
   * The example shows the similarity with `art::FindManyP`. In fact, this
   * object has a similar interface, and a similar functionality too.
   * Nevertheless, prefer using the static member `find()` and then using
   * its result directly, as it has a more complete interface:
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
   * auto showers = event.getValidHandle<std::vector<recob::Shower>>(showerTag);
   * std::size_t iShower = 0;
   * for (auto const& showerHits:
   *   lar::FindManyInChainP<recob::Hit, recob::Cluster>
   *     (showers, event, showerTag)
   *   )
   * {
   *   recob::Shower const& shower = (*showers)[iShower++];
   *   // all associated hits are already in showerHits
   *
   *   // ...
   *
   * } // for each shower
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * This is the recommended approach, as long as `lar::FindManyInChainP()` has
   * to be called only once.
   *
   * @note Due to the inability to retrieve provenance information in _gallery_,
   *       this class is not compatible with _gallery_.
   *

     * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     * the `showerHits` will pertain the `iShower`-th `recob::Shower` (`shower`)
     * on each iteration of the loop.
     *
     * The returned sequence points to objects convertible to _art_ pointers to
     * `Target` (e.g., `art::Ptr<Target>`). The order of the objects in this
     * sequence is not defined. The same `Target` object _may_ appear more than
     * once if two intermediate objects are associated to the same target (or
     * intermediate object of tier closer to the target).
     * This sequence is of an unspecified type, guaranteed to support
     * `std::begin()`, `std::end()`, `size()` method and to be iterable in a
     * range-for loop.
     * For example, it may be a STL vector returned by constant reference.
