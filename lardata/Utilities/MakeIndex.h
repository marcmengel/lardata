   * @brief Creates a map of indices from an existing collection

   * @tparam KeyOf type of the extractor of the key
   * @param data the data collection
   * @param key_of instance of a functor extracting a key value from a datum
   * @return a vector with indices corresponding to the data keys
   *
   * This function maps the index of the items in data to an integral key
   * extracted from each item.
   * For example, if the items are wires and the key_of function extracts their
   * channel ID, the resulting vector will contain for each channel ID
   * the index in data of the wire with that channel ID.
   *
   * The key is converted into a unsigned integer (`size_t`).
   * If multiple items have the same key, the outcome for that key is undefined.
   * If no items has a specific key, the index of that key is assigned as
   * @code std::numeric_limits<size_t>::max() @endcode, i.e. an index larger
   * than the size of the original data collection.
   *
   * The returned vector is big enough to accommodate indices corresponding to
   * the keys of all the items in data. It may contain "holes" (that is, some
   * keys that have no corresponding items have a
   * @code std::numeric_limits<size_t>::max() @endcode value).
   * The memory allocated for the vector may be larger than necessary (if that
   * is a problem, `std::vector::shrink_to_fit()` can be used, but it may create
   * more problems than it solves).
