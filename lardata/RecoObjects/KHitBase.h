/// \brief  Base class for Kalman filter measurement.
///
/// \author H. Greenlee
///
/// This class represents a general measurement on a surface.
///
/// This class includes the following attribute.
///
/// 1.  Measurement surface.
/// 2.  Measurement plane index.
/// 3.  Prediction surface.
/// 4.  Prediction distance.
/// 5.  Unique id.
///
/// Each constructor initializes the unique id to zero.  Derived classes
/// may set the unique id if they wish (the unique id is protected).
///
/// This class has the following pure virtual methods.
///
/// 1.  Prediction method, in which the predicted track object (state
///     vector + error matrix) is passed into the measurement to
///     generate a prediction in the measurement coordinate system.
///
/// 2.  Accessor for incremental chisquare.
///
/// 3.  Update method, in which the track object is passed in and is
///     updated according to the Kalman updating formula.
///
/// This class does not include in its interface anything having to do
/// with concrete measurements, predictions, or residuals, or anything
/// with a variable dimension.
///
/// This class has two surface data members.  Member fMeasSurf is the
/// idealized measurement surface, which is set on construction and
/// never changes.  Member fPredSurf is used to remember the track
/// surface used to make a prediction.  It is updated (by derived
/// class) every time method predict is called.
///
/// As with KTrack, the surface attributes are polymorphic, and is held
/// via std::shared_ptr type of smart pointer, which handles memory
/// management using reference-counted shared ownership.
