  /**
   * @brief Class managing the creation of a new recob::Wire object
   *
   * In order to be as simple as possible (Plain Old Data), data products like
   * recob::Wire need to be stripped of most of their functions, including the
   * ability to communicate whether a value we try to store is invalid
   * (that would require a art::Exception -- art -- or at least a message on the
   * screen -- MessageFacility) and the ability to read things from event,
   * services (e.g. geometry) etc.
   *
   * A Creator is a class that creates a temporary data product, and at the
   * end it yields it to the caller for storage.
   * This last step should be by move construction, although a copy method is
   * also provided.
   *
   * An example of creating a Wire object:
   *
   *     // let RoIsignal be a recob::Wire::RegionsOfInterest_t already filled
   *     // with the signal regions, and rawdigit the raw::RawDigit of the
   *     // channel; RoIsignal will become empty
   *     recob::WireCreator wire(std::move(RoIsignal), rawdigit);
   *     wires.push_back(wire.move()); // wire content is not valid any more
   *
   * This is a one-step creation object: the wire is constructed at the same
   * time the WireCreator is, and no facility is offered to modify the
   * constructed wire, or to create another one.
