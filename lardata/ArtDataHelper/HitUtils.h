     * @brief Query object connecting a hit to a wire
     *
     * Once upon a time, recob::Hit had a art::Ptr<recob::Wire> in it, and life
     * was easy.
     * When it was discovered that art pointers in data products were evil, they
     * were banned from recob::Hit.
     * As always, evil turns out to be convenient.
     * This query object tries to provide in an efficient way a connection
     * between a hit and the wire that has generated it.
     *
     * This object expects
     *
     * Example of usage: let hit_ptr be a valid art::Ptr<recob::Hit>. Then
     *
     *     HitToWire HtoW(evt);
     *     art::Ptr<recob::Wire> wire_ptr = HtoW[hit_ptr];
     *
     * If the association label is known, it can be used to selectively load
     * that association:
     *
     *     HitToWire HtoW(evt, AssociationInputTag);
     *     art::Ptr<recob::Wire> wire_ptr = HtoW[hit_ptr];
     *
     * that has little advantage (in fact, it is possibly slower) respect to
     * using art::FindOneP.
